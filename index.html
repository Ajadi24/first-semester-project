    <article>
      <p><i>Hello and welcome to my webpage.</i> </p>
    <p>
      My name is <b>Ajadi Quadri Adedeji</b>.  I am passionate about learning new
      things. I am an Altschooler studying <b>Cloud Engineering</b> with the School of
      Engineering. My Student ID is <b>ALT/SOE/024/0442</b>. 
    </p>

    <div>
      I had my first degree in mechanical engineering from the <b><i>Federal
        University of Technology, Akure</i></b> .  I currently work as a maintenance
      specialist with a glass manufacturing company.
      The reason I joined Altschool Africaâ€™s School of Engineering is to learn
      how to help businesses scale their operations with cloud technologies. I
      will like to take on experiences that will build upon this.
      </div>
    <p><i> <b>I intend to achieve the following within the next one year at Altschool Africa</b>:</i>
